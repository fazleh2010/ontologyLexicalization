First direction: predict whether a certain word appears in abstract given the object of the property.
P(word | objectOfPropertyParty)=P(word and objectOfPropertyParty)/P(objectOfPropertyParty)
Example:
word=british
Object of the property party=http://dbpedia.org/resource/Labor_Party_UK (short form res:Labor_Party_UK)

P(british | res:Labor_Party_UK)= 
P(british & res:Labor_Party_UK) / P(res:Labor_Party_UK)

P(british and res:Labor_Party_UK)=the number of entities where object of the property is res:Labor_Party_UK and abstract contains the word british.
P(res:Labor_Party_(UK)): all entities with the object of the property is res:Labor_Party_UK

Second direction: predict the object of the property given certain word in abstract 
P(objectOfPropertyParty | word)=
P(word and objectOfPropertyParty)/P(word)

P(res:Labor_Party_UK | british)= 
P(british & res:Labor_Party_UK / P(british)
P(british): all entities of the property party in which its abstract contain the word british


-----Calculating patterns probability--------------------

For all entities of dbo:Politician

P(s_p_o' | s_context_o')=P(s_p_o' & s_context_o')/P(s_context_o')

P(s_p_o' & s_context_o')=number of entities where (s_p_o') triple holds and abstract contains (s_context_o').
P(s_context_o'): all entities where the abstract contains s_context_o'.  
Since context is 5 words. It is very unlikely that we have match of s_context_o' in many entities. 

An example:
s_p_o'
=s(Ann_Widdecombe) dbo:religion o'<Roman_Catholicism>
=s dbo:religion o'<Roman_Catholicism>

s_context_o'
=s(ann widdecombe) [convert from anglicanism ] o'<roman catholicism>
=s [convert from anglicanism ] o'<roman catholicism>

P(s dbo:religion o'<Roman_Catholicism> | s [convert from anglicanism ] o'<roman catholicism>)=
P([s dbo:religion o'<Roman_Catholicism> & s [convert from anglicanism ] o'<roman catholicism>)/P(s [convert from anglicanism ] o'<roman catholicism>)

P(s dbo:religion o'<Roman_Catholicism>  & s [convert from anglicanism ] o'<roman catholicism>)=number of entities where (s dbo:religion o'<Roman_Catholicism>) triple holds and abstract contains (s [convert from anglicanism ] o'<roman catholicism>).
P(s [convert from anglicanism ] o'<roman catholicism>): all entities where the abstract contains s [convert from anglicanism ] o'<roman catholicism>.  
context is 5 words. It is very unlikely that we will find match. 

Our ultimate goal is 
convert from anglicanism> dbo:religion
